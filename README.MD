### [Proteomics Data Mining Challenge 2020](https://www.lcmsmethods.org/research-1)

This repository contains the notebooks used to compete in the Proteomics Data Mining Challenge. The challenge consisted of reanalyzing a mass spectrometry dataset by Bereman et al. [1] to find PTM biomarkers for ALS.

Notebook overview:

- als_classification.ipynb: Random forest model to classify disease status (ALS versus healthy) using label-free protein quantification (spectral counting) features.
- modifications.ipynb: Exploration of mass differences mapping to PTMs in the open search data.
